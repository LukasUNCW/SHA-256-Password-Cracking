In order to run the code against the rockyou password database, you need to redirect to this link,
https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt and install the txt file (the file is rather large).
After doing so, move the txt file into the same directory as the Python3 file and run accordingly.
