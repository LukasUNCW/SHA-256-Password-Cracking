# SHA-256 Hash Password Cracking

The following code attempts to crack a password hash using something called a dictionary attack.

It takes a SHA-256 hash and attempts to find the password that, when hashed, matches the given hash.

This Python file utilizes two different libraries: 'pwn' and the 'sys' library.

The 'pwn' library imports functions commonly used in cybersecurity.

The 'sys' library imports system functions to handle command-line arguments.

The 'sys' Python library comes pre-installed in most IDEs, but to install the 'pwn' library, you will need to run the following command inside your desired IDE terminal: pip install pwn.

Links to the 'pwn' documentation are below, as well as some definitions for those who are unfamiliar with certain concepts.

Dictionary attack - an attempted illegal entry to a computer system that uses a dictionary word list to generate possible passwords.
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) - a patented cryptographic hash function created by the NSA (National Security Agency), that outputs a value that is 256 bits long.
Hash - a fixed-length string of characters that is generated by a mathematical function (in this example, SHA-256) from an input, such as a password.
Password hashing - When a password is hashed, the hash is what gets stored or transmitted, not the password itself. 
This makes hashes useful for security because even if someone gains access to the hash, they can't directly figure out the password.
